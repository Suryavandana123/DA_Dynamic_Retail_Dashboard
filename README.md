# Dynamic Retail Dashboard

## Overview

The **Dynamic Retail Dashboard** is an interactive Excel-based solution designed to provide comprehensive insights into retail business operations. The dashboard is connected to three key data tablesâ€”**Orders**, **Returns**, and **People**â€”which are hosted on GitHub. Using Excel's Power Query Editor, the data is loaded, transformed, and visualized in a dynamic manner, offering a holistic view of key business metrics.

The dashboard provides dynamic charts and KPIs, enabling users to analyze sales, profit margins, customer trends, and more. It is a powerful tool for business decision-making, allowing stakeholders to monitor and assess performance across various dimensions like product categories, regions, and customer segments.

## Data Transformation and Preparation

### Power Query Editor

Before building the dashboard, Power Query Editor was used to perform several transformations on the data:

1. **Loading the Data**: The data tables from GitHub were linked to the Excel file and loaded using Power Query.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Invalid or missing values were handled, ensuring that only relevant data was included in the analysis.
3. **Data Merging**: The Orders, Returns, and People tables were merged to create a single data model for easy reporting and analysis.
4. **Creating Relationships**: Appropriate relationships between tables were established to allow for cross-table analysis.
5. **Column Creation**: New calculated columns (e.g., Profit Margin) were added to enhance the analysis.
6. **Filtering**: Only relevant data was filtered based on business needs (e.g., excluding cancelled orders).

These transformations were necessary to ensure the data was clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

## Dashboard Construction

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Data was fetched from GitHub repositories containing the **Orders**, **People**, and **Returns** tables. These datasets were imported into Excel and linked using Power Query.

### Step 2: Data Transformation
- Using Power Query, the data was transformed into a usable format. Unnecessary rows were removed, data was cleaned (e.g., handling missing values), and new calculated columns were created, such as **Profit Margin** and **Total Sales**.

### Step 3: KPI Definition
- Key metrics like **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Total Quantity**, **Number of Orders**, and

 **Profitability** were defined using Excel formulas. These KPIs were designed to reflect the most critical aspects of business performance.

### Step 4: Visualizations
- Various charts were created, such as:
  - **Bar and line charts** to track sales and profit trends.
  - **Pie charts** for category-wise sales and profit breakdown.
  - **Dynamic slicers** to filter data by product, region, or time.
- Each chart was designed to be dynamic, updating automatically based on user input.

### Step 5: Dashboard Interactivity
- Slicers and filters were added to make the dashboard interactive. Users can select regions, time periods, and product categories to view specific metrics and performance details.
- The dashboard is updated automatically based on the selections made by users.
